            of destiny and karma, revealing actionable pathways for the future.
            This is where Prashna Siddhi’s astrological insights can be of

            What is Destiny in Astrology?
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700 font-poppins text-center text-xl">
            Destiny can be visualized as the foundation of a building - a
            predetermined structure that influences life’s possibilities.
            However, within that framework, we can choose how to construct our
            experiences. Can a canopy of 100 feet stand on a foundation meant
            for 60x40 feet? Without adequate support, aspirations may collapse.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700 font-poppins text-center text-xl">
            This structural analogy perfectly illustrates Karmic Law: “As you
            sow, so shall you reap.” The greater our desires, the wider the gap
            between expectations and reality. This gap represents life’s
            challenges. Prashna Siddhi’s astrology consultation helps assess
            where you stand, what is achievable, and how to align goals with
            karmic principles.

            The only constant in life is change. While the Birth Chart serves as
            a static reference, planetary movements shape our experiences. The
            traditional Vimshottari Dasha System maps time cycles, but
            birth-time inaccuracies may affect precision. In contrast, Prashna
            Kundali is dynamic, requiring no birth details. Instead, it captures
            the exact planetary alignment at the moment a question is asked,
            providing real- time astrological guidance. Aarooda Lagna, derived
            through divine cowries, further refines astrological predictions.
            Aligning with Karmic Law: Free Will Within Limits If you wish to
            climb a hill, would you descend first before making the climb?
            No—you start from where you stand. Similarly, Prashna Siddhi’s
            Prashna Kundali reflects reality as it is in the present moment. It
            bypasses assumptions and instead provides precise astrological
            guidance based on planetary energies and karmic influences.

                <br />
                Astrology identifies three types of Karma:
                <br />• Kriyaman Karma – Current actions influencing future
                consequences.
                <br /> • Prarabdha Karma – Fixed destiny for this lifetime.
                <br /> • Sanchit Karma – The accumulated karma stored over
                lifetimes (8th House influence).
                <br />
                Misconceptions about the 8th House often mislead astrologers. A
                nuanced approach, considering planetary aspects—especially
                Jupiter and Saturn - is essential. Jupiter, the planet of divine
                grace, brings significant influences depending on its placement.

              Problems in life are not punishments but reflections of past
              actions. When we do good deeds, we expect rewards; when we err, we
