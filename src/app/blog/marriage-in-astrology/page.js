            Marriage marks one of the most important transitions in life. It's a
            phase filled with high hopes and deep emotional investment.
            Naturally, everyone aspires to find the best life partner and
            desires a smooth, timely marriage. But how realistic is that in
            today's karmically complex world?

            Conventional Kundali Matching and Its Limitations
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            Most marriage astrology consultations begin and end with{" "}
            <strong>Kundali matching</strong>, often based solely on{" "}
            <strong>birth stars (Nakshatras)</strong>. Matrimonial websites and
            matchmaking software have popularized ready-to-use compatibility
            charts. But do they really reflect the truth of a soul's destiny?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            Unfortunately, many couples still end up in divorce, custody
            battles, or strained relationships. Clearly, mere matching of charts
            doesn't guarantee a happy marriage.

            What Real Astrology Can Reveal About Marriage
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            Astrology cannot change destiny—but it can peek into it. A skilled
            astrologer must go beyond templates and delve into{" "}
            <strong>personalized karmic indicators</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            When analyzing marriage from an astrological perspective, certain{" "}
            <strong>key houses and planets</strong> take precedence:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6 text-gray-800">
            <li>
              <strong>7th House (Bhava):</strong> Primary indicator of marriage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2nd and 11th Houses:</strong> Support family expansion and
              social bonding.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>8th House (for women):</strong> Known as "Mangalya
              Sthana", linked with longevity of married life.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Venus and Mars:</strong> Commonly associated with love and
              physical compatibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dasha-Bhukti (Planetary Periods):</strong> Critical in
              predicting marriage timing.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            However, all this depends on the{" "}
            <strong>accuracy of the birth time</strong> and must include{" "}
            <strong>asterism (Nakshatra) analysis</strong>, not just planetary
            positions.

            Many are discouraged due to labels like "Manglik Dosha" or negative
            interpretations of Venus in the 7th house. Such cookie-cutter

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            Astrology must be approached holistically, not through fear-based
            interpretations.
