            Introduction: The Age-Old Faith in Muhurta
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <em>Muhurta</em>, a Sanskrit term meaning "moment," typically
            implies an <em>auspicious</em> moment—<em>shubha muhurta</em>—chosen
            from calendars and clocks created by human intelligence. In essence,
            it's an attempt to "time" events to ensure favourable outcomes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In India especially, this belief has flourished for centuries.
            There's a deep-rooted faith that anything initiated at the right
            muhurta will prosper. But at its core, this belief is a motivational
            construct—a mindset to feel optimistic and hopeful. Society, by and
            large, accepts that if something is begun at an auspicious time, it{" "}
            <em>ought</em> to succeed. It becomes a kind of self-declared
            prophecy, a morale booster.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            But what are we really timing? Most often, it's events aimed at{" "}
            <em>material prosperity</em>, completely bypassing the divine or
            spiritual dimension.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 mb-8">
            <p className="font-salernomi text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">
              Is it "our will" or "Divine Will" that truly prevails?
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              If humanly fixed timings were absolute, then why do even carefully
              calculated wedding muhurtas—often consulted from multiple
              astrologers—still result in failed marriages? The rise of cases in
              family courts makes us wonder: Did the astrologers go wrong, or is
              the method itself flawed? The answer is worth pondering.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-gray-100 p-6 mb-8">
            <p className="font-salernomi text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-2">
              Who fixed the moment of our own birth—the very first muhurta of
              our lives?
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Was <em>that</em> an auspicious time? What does "auspicious" even
              mean in the grand scheme of destiny?
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            In reality, ceremonies and rituals may adhere to muhurta, but when
            outcomes don't align, we are left gasping. Faith, belief, and the
            grandeur of rituals may abound—but rarely do they guarantee the end
            result.

            The Soul's Timing vs Clock Timing

            Childbirth — A Divine Prerogative
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In my long experience, I've often been asked to determine an
            auspicious muhurta for caesarean births—an entirely human-made
            opportunity to "schedule" birth. I have always declined.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-semibold">
            Why? Because Divine Timing cannot be manipulated.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            In multiple cases, even after pundits had fixed an ideal time for
            delivery, things went awry—the surgeon was late, the anaesthetist
            was delayed. The universe, it seemed, had other plans.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Instead, what truly works—if done with sincerity—is the{" "}
            <strong>Vedic Prashna</strong>, a method that invokes divine grace
            without relying on the clock. With prayer, integrity, and detachment
            from commercial motives, Vedic Prashna has offered real, actionable
            guidance to many.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            It helps people find courage and clarity—not through muhurta, but
            through the movement of Divine Will.
            <br />
            No timing. No charts. Just pure inner sincerity, openness, and
            receptivity.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-salernomi text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">
            Muhurta Can Align—But Only When the Soul Is Ready
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Let me share a real case. A wealthy individual once consulted me to
            find the best possible muhurta for open-heart surgery in the United
            States—a matter of life and death.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            I didn't check calendars. I prayed deeply and cast a{" "}
            <strong>Vedic Prashna Kundali</strong>. The reading revealed
            long-distance travel within the next 1.5 months and also highlighted{" "}
            <strong>Mars exciting the 6th house</strong>—a clear signal of
            medical intervention.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            The client dismissed it. He said there was <em>no way</em> he could
            make travel arrangements in such a short time—it would take three
            months, at least.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            And yet, within the timeframe predicted by the Prashna, he called
            me—<em>from his hospital bed in the U.S.</em>, post-surgery. It had
            all unfolded as revealed.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 mb-8">

              Was it human logic or Divine Timing at work?
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              That is why I call Vedic Prashna a{" "}
              <strong>"real-time signal from the Divine"</strong>, not a product
              of man-made clocks and calendars. How often we respect the
              clock—and still walk into chaos.

            Conclusion: Timing Is Not Math—It's Grace
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            True timing is never about calculations or cerebral logic. It is
            about surrendering to Divine Grace. Yes, we must put forth our best
            effort, guided by dharma and sincerity. But the final outcome? That
            is never in our hands.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Standard time zones</strong> exist for trade, aviation,
              and global coordination—not for divine matters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Daylight saving time</strong> in some countries alters
              clocks artificially. What then is the <em>real</em> birth time of
              babies born during such shifts?
            </li>
            <li>
              These questions are endless—and they expose the limitations of
              human-created timekeeping.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">And finally, reflect on this:</p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            <strong>Rahu and Ketu</strong>—the shadowy nodes with no physical
            form—are considered the <em>Karmic Timekeepers</em>. They hold the
            secrets of time, transformation, and destiny.
            <br />
            The Universe is not run by muhurtas. It is run by the Creator—who
            doesn't need calendars to govern His 84 lakh species.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            So why do <em>we</em> believe we can outwit His timing?
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Instead of forcing events through mathematical muhurtas, let us{" "}
            <strong>surrender to His Will</strong>. Let us receive{" "}
            <strong>His Muhurta</strong> with humility and devotion, not chase
            fabricated ones for ego-driven pursuits.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Use astrology not as a blueprint to build empires, but as a{" "}
            <strong>spiritual compass</strong> to become more surrendered, more
            intuitive, more devoted.
