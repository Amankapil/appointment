            Let's ask a crucial question:

            <strong>Who is estimating your possibilities?</strong>

            Is it based on reality? Or is it driven by desire disguised as

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            We often <strong>overestimate possibilities</strong> simply because
            we <em>want</em> them to exist. "Desire to deserve" is the silent
            whisper behind every expectation—but{" "}
            <strong>does desire alone validate the possibility?</strong>

                Many of us base our expectations on the so-called{" "}
                <strong>Law of Averages</strong>. But here's the truth:
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
                The Law of Averages is <em>not</em> a statistical or
                mathematical model.
                <br />
                It's a cognitive illusion rooted in <em>common sense</em>, not{" "}
                <em>common truth</em>.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            Let me illustrate:
          </p>
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-300 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-8">
            "100 Indians are weighed. The average weight is 65 kg. So, anyone
            under 65 kg is unfit to be a security guard."
          </blockquote>

          <div className="flex justify-center mb-8">
            <div className="relative w-full h-[500px]">

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            Sounds ridiculous? Exactly!
            <br />

            The Danger of Comparison

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            Let's now bring this home with some real-life examples:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-8 text-gray-800">
            <li>
              <em>
                "My neighbour's daughter got married at 25, why not mine at 26?"
              </em>

            <li>
              <em>
                "That elderly man looks so healthy at 75, why am I pre-diabetic
                at 45?"
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            These aren't just comparisons—they're silent accusations against
            destiny, <strong>driven by frustration</strong>, not facts.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            But the truth is:{" "}
            <strong>everyone has a different karmic ledger</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6 text-gray-800">
            Comparing your journey to someone else's is like{" "}

            wildly different.
