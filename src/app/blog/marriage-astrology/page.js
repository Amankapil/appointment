            Marriage is often celebrated as a sacred bond — but anyone who has
            lived it knows it can also become a source of doubt, conflict, and
            silent struggle. Dreams shaped by childhood, society, and movies
            often collide with the raw reality of daily life. Why do some
            marriages thrive while others crumble under pressure? The answer
            lies not only in communication or habits but also in deeper, unseen
            influences that shape human relationships. Vedic Prashna Kundali
            provides a dynamic lens to uncover these hidden truths — revealing
            compatibility, exposing potential stress points, and guiding couples
            toward harmony. This is not about rigid formulas or blind tradition,
            but about real, divine insight for today’s relationships.

            Marriage and Astrology: A Deeper Perspective
          </h2>

          <p>
            Marriage is often called a sacred bond — yet in reality, it can
            become one of the greatest sources of worry and anxiety. When love
            fades, trust weakens, or families clash, people look for clarity.
            Astrology offers an ancient but precise lens to see why struggles
            arise — and more importantly, what can be done.

            Marriage – a holistic look:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Marriage is an even which on an average is subject which
            automatically comes up around the age of 25 normally. That is when
            one expects some sort of a settlement in life may happen. This
            translates to having undergone metamorphosis from infancy to
            adulthood and by then a number of habits, desires and attitude would
            be the fountainhead of life. There are many serious points one had
            to account for like – circumstances, association and economic
            situation of the family one grows up. Attitudes converge together
            and becomes a mindset which is difficult to change and that is when
            one looks for a life partner.

          <p>
            A general assumption of longevity if taken as 75 years, can we say
            one third of the life of 25 years is a sort of foundation on which
            boy and girl would have built their dreams in a way and each one
            expects the other to fulfill the dream. The critical question
            whether the dream is good and achievable or not is totally ignored
            apart from whether at all the dream is fundamentally and morally
            good or not.
          </p>

          <p>
            Obviously, both the boy and girl will have their own dream. This is
            exactly the point which makes a relationship or breaks. Astrology,
            specifically Vedic Prashna Kundali of Prashna Siddhi can help a lot
            to analyze the personality traits generally and specifically
            regarding marriage.

          <p className="mb-4">
            The early days or months of marriage are a period of adjustment, and
            misunderstandings are common as couples navigate their new life

                  <em>Romanticized Views:</em> Many people enter marriage with
                  idealized expectations, often influenced by movies, social
                  media, or societal norms. When reality doesn’t align with

                <p>
                  <em>Unspoken Assumptions:</em> In the early stages, couples
                  may assume they “know” what their partner wants or needs, but
                  assumptions often lead to miscommunication. For example,
                  thinking your partner should “just know” that you’re upset
                  without expressing it verbally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Conflict Avoidance:</em> Some couples may avoid conflicts
                  in the beginning to keep things peaceful. However, unaddressed
                  small issues can snowball over time, leading to bigger
                  arguments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Differing Communication Styles:</em> One partner may want
                  to talk things through immediately, while the other may need
                  time to process. This mismatch can create tension if not
                  managed.

                  <em>Living Habits and Routine Differences:</em> Each person
                  comes into a marriage with their own habits, some of which may
                  seem small but are annoying or confusing to the other person
                  (e.g., different approaches to cleanliness, mealtime routines,
                  or sleep schedules).

                  watch—they might discover that they have completely different

                  <em>Past Experiences:</em> Unresolved issues from past
                  relationships or childhood can influence how one or both
                  partners behave. For example, one partner may have trust
                  issues stemming from a past betrayal, which may cause
                  unnecessary tension in the marriage.

                  <em>Attachment Styles:</em> Different attachment styles
                  (secure, anxious, avoidant) can play a big role. An anxious
                  partner may crave constant reassurance, while an avoidant one
                  may pull away in times of stress, which can create confusion
                  and frustration.

                  <em>Intimacy Expectations:</em> Couples often need time to
                  adjust to each other’s levels of closeness and comfort.
                  Differences in expectations or preferences can create feelings
                  of being misunderstood, unappreciated, or distant. Open and

                  partner may equate emotional closeness with physical
                  togetherness, while the other sees them as separate. When
                  these needs don’t align, disappointment or confusion may
                  arise. Recognizing and valuing both forms of intimacy
                  strengthens the relationship.

                  (spending vs. saving) or lack of discussion about money can
                  create tension early on. If one partner is more financially

            to feel a little bumpy at first, but working together to understand
            each other’s perspectives can help build a solid foundation. Do you
            think any of these are particularly relevant for you or someone you
            know?

            Kundali Matching vs. Prashna Kundali
          </h2>

          <p>
            The word Marriage immediately draws one to Kundali matching! While
            Kundali matching is tradition-based and static, Vedic Prashna
            Kundali is dynamic and instantaneous. It reflects cosmic energy at
            the exact moment of a question, revealing divine answers as per
            one’s destiny.

            Temperament and Planetary Influence
          </h3>
          <p>
            Temperamental issues often top the list of marital problems. Mars,
            the planet of creation and destruction, triggers conflicts, while
            Saturn can fuel them further. These influences explain why even
            relatives often get pulled into disputes between spouses.

            Separation or Divorce
          </h3>
          <p>
            Divorce affects not just the couple but children and families on
            both sides. Astrology helps highlight potential conflicts and guides
            reconciliation, offering hope where situations appear bleak.

            Why Prashna Kundali Works
          </h3>
          <p>
            Unlike book-rule astrology, Prashna Kundali allows instant analysis
            based on intent or even just a name. It is holistic, dynamic, and
            capable of revealing relationship truths without depending solely on
            birth charts.

            Marriage and the 7th House
          </h3>
          <p>
            Many astrologers focus only on the 7th house, but true compatibility
            also requires examining Moon–Mars harmony, Jupiter’s influence, and
            timing of planetary periods (Dasa). Overemphasis on Venus or the 7th
            house alone can mislead.

            Case Study: The 7th House & Real-Life Marriage
          </h2>

          <p>
            Many astrologers would immediately predict problems or even denial
            of marriage based on the following combinations:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>7th lord placed in the 6th house</li>
            <li>
              Jupiter in the 7th house in the Nakshatra of Mercury (a dual-sign
              owner) → multiple relationships possible
            </li>
            <li>
              Jupiter (Deva Guru) in the 7th house for a Lagna ruled by Venus
              (Rakshasa Guru) → incompatibility suggested
            </li>

            <li>
              8th lord placed in the 7th house → threat to longevity of
              relationship
            </li>
            <li>
              Saturn, Moon, and Sun clustered in Leo → Sun under pressure from a
              bitter enemy Saturn
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            By textbook rules, this chart screamed “marital disharmony” or
            “divorce.”
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Truth & Reality:</strong> The native got married during the
            Dasa of Rahu (positioned in the 12th house) — and has remained
            happily married, without any sign of separation.
          </p>

          <p>
            👉 The lesson here is clear: Astrology is not about rigid formulas.
            Real interpretation requires wisdom, context, and understanding of
            karmic timing. Relying purely on rulebook astrology can mislead;
            applied knowledge guided by divine insight is the key.

            Conclusion
          </h2>
          <p>
            Marriage is not decided by one planet or one house alone. Harmony
            comes from mutual respect, timing, and divine guidance. At Prashna
            Siddhi, we use Vedic Prashna Kundali to offer clear, reliable
            insights into marriage and relationships.
          </p>

            <p>
              At Prashna Siddhi, we believe marriage is more than an individual
              choice — it is the foundation of families and society itself. Our
              role is not limited to charts or predictions, but to guide couples
              with clarity, compassion, and dignity so they can build lasting
              harmony in their lives.
