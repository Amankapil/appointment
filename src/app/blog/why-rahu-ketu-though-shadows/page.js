          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            Whether or not we believe in the Doctrine of Karma,{" "}
            <strong>truth stands untouched</strong>. Belief is often just a
            personal or collective sentiment. By that logic, even the existence
            of the Creator becomes a matter of debate! These are{" "}
            <strong>intellectual gymnastics</strong> that try to box the
            vastness of spiritual truth into human logic. But the{" "}
            <strong>Science of the Soul</strong> has only been mastered by
            saints, sages, and mystics—not by intellectuals.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            Astrology is a sacred by-product of the{" "}
            <strong>Doctrine of Karma</strong>, the governing law of the
            Universe. Without this foundational understanding, astrology becomes
            a lifeless shell—<strong>an orphaned system</strong> devoid of
            purpose or spiritual truth.

            Why Are Rahu & Ketu—Shadows—Still Treated as Planets?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            The answer lies not in astronomy but in{" "}
            <strong>spiritual realism</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6 text-gray-800">
            <li>
              The <strong>Sun</strong> represents the{" "}
              <strong>immortal Soul</strong>, shining unconditionally.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <strong>Moon</strong>, on the other hand, signifies the{" "}
              <strong>Mind</strong>, which is ever restless, pulled by the five
              senses (Panchendriyas). It is this mind that{" "}
              <strong>seeks, craves, grasps</strong>, and still remains{" "}
              <strong>dissatisfied</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The greed never stops barking. The longing never ends. And thus,
              because of the mind, the{" "}
              <strong>entire world remains in suffering</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            Rahu and Ketu operate within this framework. Their shadow nature is
            what makes them <strong>perfect karmic instruments</strong>, syncing
            seamlessly with our intentions and actions.

            Why Are Rahu & Ketu Shadows?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            This very question has <strong>deep karmic roots</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            Rahu and Ketu <strong>aren't physical masses</strong>. They have{" "}
            <strong>no fixed form, color, or size</strong>. And that is{" "}
            <strong>a divine blessing</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">Why?</p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            If karma were delivered only through fixed, tangible celestial
            bodies, then criminals would remain criminals eternally. Wrongdoers
            would dominate forever. But because{" "}
            <strong>Rahu and Ketu are shadows</strong>, they can{" "}
            <strong>transform</strong>, allowing room for{" "}
            <strong>remorse, reform, and redemption</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            Their very flexibility <strong>embodies the law of Karma</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mt-6 text-gray-800">
            <li>Every action has a consequence.</li>
            <li>A good deed yields good fruit.</li>
            <li>A harmful deed brings suffering.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>As you sow, so shall you reap.</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6 text-gray-800">
            Thus, the Creator dispenses justice with{" "}
            <strong>flawless precision</strong>—no bias, no favoritism.

            This, again, is <strong>not a flaw but a divine design</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            Because they own no signs, they remain{" "}

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6 text-gray-800">
            As Supreme Karmic Auditors, Rahu and Ketu analyze our{" "}

            Conclusion: A Spiritual Wake-Up Call

            Rahu and Ketu—though shadows—<strong>wield more power</strong> over
            our lives than any physical planet.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            Their <strong>non-material nature</strong> is what makes them deeply
            spiritual, karmically aligned, and universally just. Failing to
            understand their true purpose has led astrology into a{" "}
            <strong>predictive rut</strong>, driven more by fear than
            transformation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-800">
            They <strong>don't fit</strong> into the "one size fits all"
            astrology manual. They <strong>demand depth</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>introspection</strong>, and above all,{" "}
            <strong>a spiritual perspective</strong>.

            So next time someone asks—why shadows like Rahu and Ketu are treated
            as planets?
            <br />
            Tell them:{" "}
            <strong>
              Because shadows often reveal more truth than light ever can.
