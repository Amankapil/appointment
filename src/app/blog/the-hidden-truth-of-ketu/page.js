            Introduction: Astrology Beyond Predictions
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Modern astrology, consumed by the obsession with predictions, often
            loses sight of its divine foundation. In truth,{" "}
            <strong>
              astrology is a revelation — a spiritual code encrypted in the
              Zodiac
            </strong>
            , guiding souls toward liberation, not indulgence. When we reduce it
            to a tool for satisfying desires, we betray the Creator's cosmic
            intent. True astrology speaks not in whispers but in thunderclaps of
            divine warning and karmic wisdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            And at the very root of this eternal blueprint stands{" "}
            <strong>Ketu</strong>, the{" "}
            <strong>greatest unsung benefactor of human beings</strong> — a
            shadow planet, a divine enforcer, and a karmic compass.
          </p>

            Ketu — The Kingpin of the Doctrine of Karma
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The <strong>Law of Karma</strong> is absolute:{" "}
            <em>as you sow, so shall you reap</em>. The irony? We do not recall
            our past sowing, yet we desire the choicest fruits — luxury, power,
            peace. <strong>Ketu laughs at this delusion</strong>, for he alone
            holds the signature of our past, the repository of unresolved
            intentions, actions, and mental impressions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>truth of Ketu</strong> is this: it does not punish — it
            reflects. And in doing so, it demands humility, introspection, and
            surrender.

            Karmic Law is More Than Newton's Law
          </h3>
          <p>
            Karma isn't mere reaction. It is{" "}
            <strong>
              interwoven with context, intention, and consciousness
            </strong>{" "}
            — elements that transcend matter. While science builds machines with
            dazzling precision, none can rival the cosmic justice system
            governed by <strong>Ketu</strong>. It calculates not just action,
            but emotion. Not just choice, but consequence.

            Mind is the Battlefield — Moon Is the Messenger
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Why is the <strong>Moon</strong> so critical in astrology? Because{" "}
            <strong>it governs the mind</strong>, and the mind is the canvas
            where karma is painted. Saints say:{" "}
            <em>Transcend the mind, and you transcend the world.</em>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            As the <strong>fastest-moving celestial body</strong>, Moon reflects
            the fluctuating nature of desires. These desires become seeds of
            karma. Therefore, understanding <strong>Ketu</strong>, who shadows
            the Moon's influence through Nakshatras, becomes essential to
            understanding the destiny we create.
